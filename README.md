**Overview**  
-

This project uses linear search to find the target.  
Users can input an array and a target value to complete the search.
Chose to use linear search because I have a background in linear algebra, and this approach of combining two disciplines aligns with my thinking.

---
**Decomposition**
-
The linear search algorithm can be decomposed into the following steps:

Input Processing

Data Transformation: Convert the target value to an integer.

Iteration Setup: Comparison step.

Comparison Loop   

---
**Pattern Recognition**
-
Take an element → Compare it with the target element → Make a judgment → Move to the next element.

This repetition forms a loop structure until the target element is found or the list ends.

---
**Abstract**
-

Input

Each comparison step

Total number of comparisons performed.

The comparison process is presented as step-by-step text in the output box.

---
**Algorithm Design**
-

Input → Processing → Output Flow:

Input:

Array

Processing:

Convert the array string into a list of integers.

Iterate through the list, comparing each element with the target value.

Output:

Output and display the process.

**Flowchart**  
-

-Start 

-Input array & target 

-Compare element with target 

-If match → Return index & stop 

-Else → Continue  

-If no match → Return "Not found"

**Example Usage**  
Array: `1,3,5,7,9`  
Target: `5`  
Output:  
Step 1: Compare 1 with 5  
Step 2: Compare 3 with 5  
Step 3: Compare 5 with 5  
Found 5 at index 2  
Total comparisons: 3
